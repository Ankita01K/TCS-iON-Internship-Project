# **Automate sentiment analysis of textual comments and feedback**

## **Project Overview:**
 **Automate sentiment analysis on textual comments and feedback using a deep learning model trained on sentiment-labeled Twitter data from Kaggle.**

## **Key Steps:**

**Data Preprocessing:**

Removal of punctuation, special characters, and numbers.
Tokenization, lemmatization, and stemming for text standardization.

**Feature Extraction:**

Utilization of TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) for effective feature extraction.

**Data Balancing:**

Achieved a balanced dataset using SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique) to ensure unbiased model training.

**Model Building:**
Implemented three distinct models for sentiment analysis.

Model 1: Simple Feedforward Neural Network.
Model 2: Convolutional Neural Network (CNN).
Model 3: Improved CNN with Batch Normalization, Dropout, and Early Stopping for enhanced generalization.

**Model Evaluation:**

Evaluation metrics include confusion matrix and classification report for a comprehensive performance.
